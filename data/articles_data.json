Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \n \n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \n \n\"It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \n \nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \n \nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \n \nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \n \nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \n \nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \n \nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \n \nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.", "title": "Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders", "media-type": "News", "source": "Redditch Advertiser", "published": "2015-09-07T10:16:14Z"}

For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. \n\n\"Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,\" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. \"Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred.\" \n\nUnlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. \n\nAvailable today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: \n\nAccess to real queries used by searchers \n\nPaid and organic results for any website \n\nVisibility into organic keywords, eliminating the \"not provided\" outcome in web analytics \n\nReal user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results \n\nAbility to tie keywords to real transactions on any website \n\nVariable attribution models and lookback windows \n\nLaunched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. \n\nThe company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. \n\nAbout Jumpshot \n\nJumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco. \n\nFor more information, please visit www.jumpshot.com. \n\nImage Available: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/frame_mw?attachid=2889222 \n\nKelly Mayes \n\nThe Bulleit Group \n\n615-200-8845 \n\nPublished Sep. 17, 2015 \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 SYS-CON Media, Inc. \u2014 All Rights Reserved. \n\nSyndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author.", "title": "Jumpshot Gives Marketers Renewed Visibility Into Paid and Organic Keywords With Launch of Jumpshot Elite", "media-type": "News", "source": "Virtualization Conference & Expo", "published": "2015-09-17T15:00:00Z"}

Davis Follow @allisonpdavis No photos over six hours old allowed. 37 Shares Share 29 Tweet 8 Share 0 Pin It 0 Share Email Print Share Photo: Uwe Umstaetter/Westend61/Corbis The best photo of me was taken about a few years ago: I will never again look so young, so free, or so skinny as I was in that shot. Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us. \u00a0 Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are now \u2014 bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo \u2014 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?\nAt first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.
