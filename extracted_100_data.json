The Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday. The club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders. Father-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country. He said: \"As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \"It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" He said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. Mr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. Promoted stories The reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. He was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. Mr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. The Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. The management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. Share article The next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. The breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.", "title": "Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders", "media-type": "News", "source": "Redditch Advertiser", "published": "2015-09-07T10:16:14Z"}, {"id": "609772bc-0672-4db5-8516-4c025cfd54ca", "content": "New Product Gives Marketers Access to Real Keywords, Conversions and Results Along With 13 Months of Historical Data SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09\\/17\\/15 -- Jumpshot, a marketing analytics company that uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online customer journey, today announced the launch of Jumpshot Elite, giving marketers insight into what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on your site. For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. \"Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,\" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. \"Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred.\" Unlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. Available today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: Access to real queries used by searchers Paid and organic results for any website Visibility into organic keywords, eliminating the \"not provided\" outcome in web analytics Real user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results Ability to tie keywords to real transactions on any website Variable attribution models and lookback windows Launched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. The company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. About Jumpshot Jumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco. For more information, please visit www.jumpshot.com.

Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.a0 Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us. a0 Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are now \u2014 bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo \u2014 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?At first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.

The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude. They contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, \u201cScientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.\u201d We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; \u201cwhat is my objective in saying this.\u201d \u201cAre these words going to produce life or death.\u201d Proverbs 18:21 declares, \u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u201d As a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else\u2019s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. As responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people\u2019s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person\u2019s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. Proverbs 19:1 says, \u201cBetter is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.\u201d We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. We are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. We should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. If we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, \u201cWhen a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil\u201d (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. Due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. The question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl\u2019s life, Flo-Jo. When narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, \u201cSugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.\u201d She continued and said, \u201cRight then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.\u201d With words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls\u2019 life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. Paul\u2019s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, \u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.\u201d (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.", "title": "THE INFLUENCE OF OUR WORDS", "media-type": "News", "source": "Times of Swaziland", "published": "2015-09-28T23:21:00Z"}, {"id": "402f6983-3300-4546-82c5-6f4eb08d0ba7", "content": "Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen \u2014 much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.At the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhoneThe 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.A light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions \u2014 for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.I found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.The new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPadThe iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.The iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.The large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TVThe Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.I decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.I also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said \"comedy,\" thinking I had said \"comity.\" But it did a better job with action movies \u2014 when I said \"show me action movies,\" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.The new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.The New York TimesFollow Digital Life on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "title": "Hands on with Apple's iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV", "media-type": "News", "source": "South Coast Register", "published": "2015-09-10T03:25:04Z"}, {"id": "286868ed-ab9a-4990-a4af-436df8c5bff2", "content": "SOURCE Harwood Feffer LLPNEW YORK On July 21, 2015 On this news, VASCO stock nearly 33% and has not recovered.

Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen What will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. Ms Credlina0worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint asa0opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will nota0bea0working for the incoming leader. After her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became thea0dominant figure in the Abbott government,a0described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies \u2014a0not least Mr Abbott, who called her the \"fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with\". a0As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profilea0staffers in recent politicala0history. From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirsta0anda0Claire Kimball, honing and refininga0Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. After just less thana0four years in opposition,a0 in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government,a0made the transition as chief of staff into government. But the tightly controlled approach adopted ina0oppositiona0did not worka0as smoothly in government. Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Public complaints about a \" command and control \" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. In February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and fora0political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. Ms Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. Brian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen But Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, hea0singled out his chief of staff a0\"who has been unfairly maligned by people whoa0should'vea0known better\". And now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. Mra0Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. One veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader,a0and that a change in director was not \"necessary or inevitable\". That veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of \"competitive tension\" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \"It depends on the relationship between the two of them;a0[Mr Loughnane] has served everya0leadera0since Howard. a0But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director \u2013 you can't have a situation like [former prime minister]a0Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].\" A second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was \"very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on.a0The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.\" Fairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. The former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department,a0Drew Clarke, will serve as hisa0acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt,a0who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinosa0in the office of John Howard,a0will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. Senator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitudea0of Mra0Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach,a0\"anda0have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,\" he told Sky News. \"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off;a0the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.\" Follow James Massola on Facebook .

Onto the main stage event. a0As I write this it\u2019s 30 hoursa0to game time and maybea027a0hours or so to meet up with old friends and make new ones while we talk about the present, past and future of the football program and in particular this 2015 team. We all know about the rather dramatic changes the program and the athletic department have gone through since Dec 17 th when Paul Chryst left for Wisconsin and when our new Beloved Leader, Chancellor Mark Gallagher, dropped the ax on the neck of AD Steve Pederson\u2019s tenure at Pitt. That has discussed over and overt and now its time to movea0on to reala0football! With that,a0here is your chance to give the world your Pitt vs.a0YSU game predictions. a0Please add your thoughts on why you feel your prediction will come true and, if you feel like it, throw in some individual player\u2019s work thata0you think will make it happen. I\u2019m asking for your thoughts so I\u2019ll start off with mine\u2026 In my 2015 season prediction article a0I wrote about the reasons I have some trepidation regarding our new Head Coach Pat Narduzzi\u2019s debut and how ita0willa0affect the players\u2019 on field play and the coaching staff\u2019s in-game coaching in determining the outcome of the match.a0 I\u2019m not 100% sold that Narduzzi is going to be able to go head to head this early in his career with a good, successful and well established YSU Head Coach Bo Pelini and win the game in a fashion most Pitt fans have been assuming will happen\u2026 which would bea0a blow-out Pitt win. That may not be a concern for me after the Iowa game, especially if we do well in thosea0a0two games. a0But right now there has to be a lot of wondering in the clubhouse and the coaches\u2019 offices as to what product we\u2019ll put out on the field of play. That said, we have talented football players, some extremely so, on offense, whoa0shoulda0be able to play through any worries they themselves may have and through any poor in-gamea0decisions by the staff (and there will be a few).a0 If our incumbent QB takes the reins right out of the gate and shows true leadership ofa0the offense then I\u2019ll feel better about the outcome. However, as our commenter \u201cStill the One\u201d pointed out in his comments Wednesday; Narduzzi and Chaney are looking for a good performance from transfer QB Nate Peterman early on in the game.a0 I don\u2019t believe it will be a \u2018 wait until we are a huge leada0ahead or biga0deficita0a0behind to play the backup QB \u2019 a0situation but that the staff hasa0real need for them to see Peterman playing actual football against an opponent. a0We\u2019ll discuss the outcome ofa0that move on Sunday I\u2019m sure. However,a0just the offense picking up where it left off, and actually I don\u2019t think it will especially with the jerry-rigged a0offensive line and the uncertainty at WR, doesn\u2019t guarantee us a win.a0 The defense has to be there in even better form than the offense to get a win. I believea0oura0defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly duringa0this game and week to week for a few games. a0As I\u2019ve said before I think Narduzzi and Conklin\u2019sa0plan for singlea0coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face, at least in this first game. Here is what I think after reading, writing and digesting all the Pitt footballs news, notes and opinions since Pat Narduzzi signed on the dotted line: Reed\u2019s Take: The game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point. Conner gets less than 100 yards but scores two TDs. Passing game will be OK with more use of our TEs and Peterman will impress in his playing time. We createa0turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing (at least one big pass play) and rushing yards than we hopeda0we would. Pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win\u2026 Pitt 27 \u2013 YSU 20 a0 Chip in with your thoughts as to what you think we\u2019ll see and what the outcome will be. a0We\u2019ll take a look at our predictions on Sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game. NOTE : a0We didn\u2019t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre-game Pitt Blathera0meeting.drink\\/bull throwing festivities. a0So I\u2019m asking you guysa0to meeta0at the Bettis Grill before the game. a0I\u2019ll be there at around 11:30.a0I\u2019ll try to get there earlier but have a friend\u2019s tailgate in Red 7 to visit also \u2013 he owes me $40 so I have to break his kneecap. a0After that I\u2019ll go over to Bettis\u2019 and then leave around 12:30 or so for the press box. I can\u2019t wait to see old friends and meet some new Blather followers. a0Again, check the picture out on this post\u2026 I\u2019ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else\u2019s, a blue polo shirt with \u201cBlather\u201d on it and longer hair and a DW style mustache.", "title": "2015\u2019s Opening Game Predictions", "media-type": "Blog", "source": "Pitt Blather", "published": "2015-09-04T10:43:03Z"}, {"id": "feef579d-73aa-493a-a34f-4d31ed05663f", "content": "(Marketintelligencecenter.com via COMTEX) -- After ThursdayaEUR(TM)s trading in Semtech Corp ( SMTC ) the algorithms behind MarketIntelligenceCenter.com's Artifical Intelligence Center picked out a trade that offers a 10.19% or 18.98% (for comparison purposes only), while providing 13.67% downside protection.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received \"several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department\" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. \"These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter.\" Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.", "title": "New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered", "media-type": "News", "source": "MyEastTex", "published": "2015-09-26T00:10:34Z"}, {"id": "9c957b52-513a-4b74-9f40-dd2db587153a", "content": "Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Joaquin Andujar died Tuesday in the Dominican Republic at age 62 after an extended battle with diabetes.

Here's the five key plays from the win. 1. A new school record Prairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State\u2019s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback. McDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder. 2. Second chance It took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State\u2019s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats. 3. Back on track Robert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead. 4. Bowling ball On third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall\u2019s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats\u2019 second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game. 5. Going long The play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones.", "title": "Five key plays from Texas State's home opener", "media-type": "News", "source": "University Star", "published": "2015-09-13T03:36:40Z"}, {"id": "29577f5d-b486-45a2-9953-7d0bcd3bd778", "content": "Daily Mail Sunday 27th September, 2015 'We're too broke to go on the beat': Police chiefs warn ministers that cuts mean they can't do their job as they threaten to stop street patrols and say they won't be able to protect public from rioters or terrorists?...

Candidates\u2019 promises paints a flawless Tanzania in which no one will labour for anything. If you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected, you will be petrified. Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. It seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises.a0 While Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. Candidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. Making promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. Crave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable. We should only look back into 2010 and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation. The promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented. But we are not told where this money will come from. Other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises. But we know that a better expert\u2019s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas. So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. Politicians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow. They should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony.

On Friday, a suspect led authorities on a dangerous high-speed chase through surface streets in Fontana and San Bernardino before he drove the wrong way in the northbound lanes of the freeway. He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. Lt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. \"If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas. We have had times where we fully intended that it was getting to that level and we could not deploy, based on the backdrop and the public safety there,\" he said.

The 35-year-old singer-songwriter made headlines Thursday after she reportedly weighed in on the earlier that week, confessing to a fan she felt \"embarrassed,\" \"sad\" and \"old\" while watching this year's show. \"In all seriousness; I felt sad because music is supposed to inspire. It saved my life. This trash won't save any kids life. In a world that is even scarier and with lives still worth saving, who will stand up and have soul?\" she asked. \"Disenfranchised to say the least.

Publicly, Pink trashed the annual awards show, , \"I'm convinced MTV just bought up all dispensaries before airing this show.\" Pink did give props to one performer, though, , \"Ok @ToriKelly - fan for life. Great freaking performance tonight, you live singing, guitar playing accapella sanging woman.\" After her alleged Instagram comments made the rounds, Pink defended herself via that night. \"Please look for a feud elsewhere. I have no issue with Demi Lovato or anyone else. I actually forgot she performed. I have opinions. MANY,\" she told her followers, , \"I stand by what I said. However, I didn't intend for the angry people of the world to latch on and make it into something it isn't.

LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 \\/PRNewswire\\/ --a0Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. The new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. The Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . Accomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . Ms. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. \"We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,\" says Mr. Potts. \"It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck.\" The Houston -based Potts Law Firm represents clients in a variety of personal injury claims and mass tort matters, from complex pharmaceutical cases to automobile defect cases to product liability claims. The firm currently is accepting new GM ignition switch cases and referrals. Visit www.potts-law.com a0 for more information.

Source: AAP Australians woke to a new Prime Minister on Tuesday morning and feedback from opinion pollsters has been coming in thick and fast. The new incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, is preferred by up to 70 per cent of voters according to the Morgan Poll and by a staggering 94 per cent of Coalition voters according to ReachTEL.Turnbull is opposed by a somewhat stressed Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who is supported as alternative prime minister by only 24 per cent of voters, according to Morgan, with more than a quarter of ALP voters preferring Turnbull as PM.No wonder Shorten wants to meet Turnbull to discuss the China free-trade agreement \u2014 he\u2019s probably after a joint shot for his campaign brochure.Even more tellingly, ReachTEL shows a clear majority of Greens voters \u2014 the ones supposed to deliver 90 per cent of their preferadences to Labor \u2014 support Turnbull over Shorten.This majority support for Turnbull from Greens voters came in a poll held after Turnbull was politically mugged on the way to Yarralumla and forced to hand control of waterways to the Nationals, a move that will cost votes for Nationals candidates at the next election, leading to more of their state and federal seats progressively being knocked off by challenges from Labor, the Greens and independents.ReachTEL also estimates that the election of Turnbull as PM means the swing in Western Australia\u2019s Canning by-election today should be about minus 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent predicted by all polls before the leadership spill.A week ago, an upset Labor win in Canning was possible and this result would have been consistent with the seat\u2019s former position as an ALP marginal during the Hawke and Keating years.A 5 per cent swing against the Coalition would equal the personal support attracted by Canning\u2019s former Liberal MP, the late Don Randall, suggesting the Liberals effectively retained all of their party vote.That in turn would imply the Howard battlers are firmly in the grip of the Coalition 12 months out from the next election, in Canning and comparable seats across the country, such as Lindsay in NSW or Longman in Queensland.This conclusion is confirmed by a ReachTEL national poll showing a two-party preferred vote of 50 per cent for the Turnbull-led Coalition, with a Galaxy poll showing 51 per cent. This is an increase of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the figures under Tony Abbott, and I suspect the Coalition\u2019s standing will improve adfurther, given the former prime minister\u2019s net dissatisfaction scores and the likely positive scores for Turnbull.A rough guide to the impact of Abbott on his party vote can be obtained by dividing his net dissatisfaction scores by about five, and this corresponds to an interim sugar hit to the Coalition vote of about 6 per cent.How long the hit lasts depends to some extent on how quickly disaffected conservatives in the Coalition stop sabotaging the new PM before he has had a chance to save their seats from their own poor judgment. It would help if Turnbull\u2019s backers stopped provoking Abbott loyalists by boasting about their hatchet job on the ousted PM as this is a story that appeals to political insiders but not to voters.Cheering on yesterday\u2019s men among the conservatives is yesterday\u2019s man for the ALP, Shorten, who less than a week ago was cruising to a certain victory for Labor with about 54 per cent of the two-party preferred despite net satisfaction ratings almost as bad as those of Abbott.Complacency on the part of Labor and the timidity of its leadership left the party reliant on the visceral dislike of Abbott among key groups to insulate Labor from the Greens in the ALP\u2019s inner-city seats and to make gains in marginal urban seats, especially in Victoria and South Australia.This strategy became redundant within 24 hours of Abbott\u2019s demise as many of the middle-class and professional voters Shorten thought were in the bag switched their support to the new Turnbull government. Now Shorten is Turnbull\u2019s greatest asset and the Prime Minister should do everything he can to ensure the Opposition Leader survives until the next election.My profiles of elections back to 1966 make it clear that Labor gains broad-based community support when it develops credible economic and social policies for working families in provincial cities and outer suburbs, and for middle-class families in marginal urban seats. Labor has been able to build on this foundation and go on to win elections when it has chosen leaders capable of articulating these policies during an extended period of opposition and making them relevant to key groups in marginal seats.Shorten\u2019s insipid leadership means Labor has done neither \u2014 and now it may be too late.The party\u2019s first problem is the rules put in place by Kevin Rudd to protect the leader from caucus challenges. If Shorten\u2019s net satisfaction scores don\u2019t improve and the ALP\u2019s vote begins to decline towards 45 per cent, Labor will be looking to dump him as quickly and as quietly as possible. But the rule changes make it potentially harder \u2014 unless there\u2019s a complete agreement across all the factions to ignore the rules, in effect, and let the caucus get on with it.This means a challenge could become a protracted and public fight, which would hurt Labor\u2019s vote even further. If the factions agreed Shorten had to go, his replacement would be difficult to find as the factional gene pool in the ALP is so shallow, there are no natural leaders who seem capable of dominating Turnbull in parliamentary or public debates.Even with a competent leader, Labor and the union movement have a long-running problem in rebuilding the support base they once had among skilled blue-collar men in Labor\u2019s safer urban seats and in outer urban marginals such as Canning.To become PM you need to be able to control a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives, and it helps to win more than 50 per cent of the vote, but you don\u2019t need it if you can win more than 50 per cent of the votes in more than half the seats.If you win the votes in the right seats the swing pendulum also becomes meaningless because it\u2019s adreally only a retrospective device to measure what happened and does not predict what can happen.In 1998, the ALP needed a two-party preferred swing of about 4 per cent to win a majority of seats on the pendulum and it actually managed a swing of 5.1 per cent, yet that left it still needing a swing of 0.8 per cent to win. This is because winning votes in your opponents\u2019 key seats reshuffles the seats along the pendulum even if the swing doesn\u2019t change.John Howard achieved this in 1998 by winning support from traditional Labor-voting welfare recipients and skilled blue-collar tradies in seats such as Canning.Profiling of elections back to 1966 shows that the Labor vote from tradies trended downwards from 1980 and split about 50-50 between Labor and the Coalition in 2004. The tradies profile for Labor bounced back a little in 2007 and 2010, but once more split 50-50 in 2013.Should that remain the case next year, the Coalition is likely to continue to maintain a lead of about 6 per cent among men.The decline in support for the ALP among blue-collar men during the 1980s and 90s was counterbalanced by an increase in the ALP vote among women.The female ALP vote rose in proportion to the increase in women\u2019s workforce participation rates, which went up from 34 per cent in 1961 to 53 per cent in 1993.The two-party preferred ALP vote among women pulled ahead of the equivalent figure for men in the early 80s, with many crossing to Labor via the Australian Democrats. The ALP\u2019s primary vote from women is now consistently about six points ahead of its primary vote from men. Politically this means that, since 2001, you would be likelier to find a safe Labor seat dominated by female clerks than by male tradies, and you would be just as likely to find a Labor seat dominated by female professionals as male tradies.This increased participation in the workforce by clerical and professional women has had a big pay-off for unions. Just as Labor\u2019s power base became more feminised and shifted its centre of gravity from traditional outer urban seats to move closer to the goat cheese circle, so too did the power base for the union movement.While the proportion of male union members in the private sector continues to decline, the proportion of female union members in the public sector has remained steady, although it temporarily rose in tandem with Rudd and Wayne Swan\u2019s stimulus in 2009.Public sector jobs in administration, education and health are keeping the union movement afloat, and these three industries in both sectors now account for 52 per cent of all union members.These workers have been easily persuaded by their union officials to support quotas for union members in hospitals and schools, and this focus on membership growth rather than outcomes for patients and students requires a lot of public spending and commensurately higher taxes, which of course hit private sector blue-collar jobs for blokes.This is why Labor was incapable of cutting public spending under Rudd and Julia Gillard, and why the ACTU has been desperate to secure the election of another big-spending Labor government under a weak leader who considers themselves to be dependent on union support.The evidence, however, shows that although more than half of the extra million jobs created by Labor were in public administration, education and health, there was no political return for Rudd in 2013 in terms of bigger swings to Labor from electorates containing larger numbers of voters working in these industries.Labor\u2019s lead among female voters comes from the seats dominadated by the 50 per cent of employed women in full-time jobs. They voted Labor in 2013 and swung to Labor, irrespective of their industry or union membership. The other 50 per cent of working women in the more vulnerable part-time jobs live in the aspirational middle-class seats that voted strongly for the Coalition and swung to Abbott.These tend to be the women who temporarily have given up full-time work to have children and who are seeking to re-enter the workforce by juggling childcare and effective marginal tax rates to help pay off a family mortgage and send their children to the best school they can afford.They have high levels of debt and spending, and they tend to cluster in similarly priced housing estates in marginal seats. They were political gold when I first profiled them in the early 70s and they are still political gold in the present undernourished Labor market.The challenge for Turnbull in selecting his new ministry is primarily to protect his base vote among Howard battlers.He can do this by selecting an industrial relations minister who can relate directly to blue-collar working men, and a welfare minister who doesn\u2019t poke sticks at the huge numbers of welfare recipients clustered in outer urban and provincial seats, as these voters don\u2019t consider living in relative poverty as an entitlement.To regain a degree of parity among middle-class and professional women, Turnbull clearly needs to select more of them as members of his cabinet \u2014 including women who understand what it\u2019s like to hand over a crying toddler at the childcare centre or comb the headlice out of their four-year-old after kindy, all to pay off the mortgage, save for school fees and help provide a better life for their families.If he can do that, balance the budget and generate 220,000 jobs a year, winning the next election against whoever is leading the ALP at the time should be a cinch.I wish him well. However you vote at present, given the state of our economy and our labour admarket, we all need Turnbull to succeed.John Black, a former Labor senator for Queensland, is chief executive of Australian Development Strategies, a demographic profiling company.

Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister.That was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF.A male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community.According to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our \"typical barrister\" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles.According to the article, \"After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position \u2013 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'.\"Things are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and \"your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while\".The report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives.\"Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?\" an anonymous QC told the publication.A Shadforth spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: \"This does not reflect the view of Shadforth and is not the Shadforth way.\"It won't be help Shadforth's parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain CBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation.Much has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10\u00a2.Good thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal.But they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley.In this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: \"Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks \u2013 the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand \u2013 were prescient.\"That is one way of putting it.There is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, \"build a strong management team\" and upgrade its systems \"to provide accurate management information\".Wow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013.The most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014.That is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach ASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month.But NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger.It is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco.In March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form.\"Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome \u2013 and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking \u2013 ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication,\" explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft. Fat lossSingaporean dotcom \"incubator\" Fatfish Group came back to the market with a Plan B on Tuesday after its investors gave it a lesson in democracy last week. They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy.Fatfish said that, after consulting with iCandy's board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains \"committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing\" of iCandy.To avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders.Mind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir.It appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards.This means the purchase of one particular Fatfish business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as \"goodwill on acquisition\".This basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million.

Ali Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country \u2014 though not as much as many Iranians would want. The lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. Larijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms \"acceptable.\" \"I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,\" he said. Indeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. Critics In The Iranian Legislature The assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. He has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. He pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. \"But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,\" he said. Larijani sees many of Iran's concessions \u2014 like removing the core of a reactor \u2013 as permanent. His concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. Larijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. \"If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go \u2014 to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it.\" His remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. It's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. The U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. U.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option The United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. In an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:\"We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights.\" That matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, \"absolutely\" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. So how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? Larijani suggested that could lead to trouble. \"There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,\" he said. \"The text said that no country will go after new sanctions.\" If Iran views the other side as violating the deal, \"we will respond accordingly.\" The two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. \"I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,\" Larijani said. But, he added, \"if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it.\" Will Reforms Follow? Larijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. This was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. \"I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,\" Larijani answered. \"So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,\" Larijani said. \"I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive.\" He dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. Asked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. Asked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. A Way To Move Forward Larijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. \"Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,\" he said. Larijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Working through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. \"I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,\" he said, \"and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other.\" As translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: \"You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. So what does this mean? If you really want to do \u2014 to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does \u2014 does it solve anything? Is it of any use?\" A Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently\u2014he did not literally say \"go with it\"\u2014but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. A provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? Larijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. He described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States \u2014 just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran.", "title": "Iran Parliament Chief: Nuclear Deal Is 'Acceptable,' U.S. Interpretation Is Not", "media-type": "News", "source": "WAMC.org", "published": "2015-09-08T10:07:31Z"}, {"id": "c35a4d55-b487-406d-b806-abced6a8cd91", "content": "Created: 09\\/08\\/2015 4:52 PM WNYT.com By: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market: NYSE Meredith Corp., up $4.53 to $50.47 The TV station owner and publisher of Parents magazine is being bought by TV station owner Media General Inc. for $2.4 billion.

Past News Releases RSS Chicago, IL (PRWEB) September 15, 2015 Lenders like The Federal Savings Bank are always keeping tabs on rental markets across the USA. Strong rental markets usually also contain strong real estate markets. The Federal Savings Bank was intrigued by data released in a CNN Money article from August 19th titled \u201c America's most expensive rental markets \u201d. Perhaps surprisingly, 10 out of the 15 markets presented resided in California. Due to the abundance of tech companies and high salaries, Cali is the most abundantly expensive state to live in terms of rents. The average percentage of income spent on rent in all 10 California cities was above 40% for: Salinas, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose. Above 40% is a very high level. For Los Angeles, where the median income is $61,482, the average percentage of income spent on rent is 48.9%. Just think of how much money could be saved by owning instead of renting! Washington D.C. while expensive at a $2,104 per month level of rent, showed the lowest percentage of income spent on rent at just 26.8% thanks to high median incomes of the area at $94,204. The Federal Savings Bank believes high costing rental markets are places that give an incentive to first-time home buyers the most to purchase a property. With home prices on the rise and 30-year fixed mortgage rates continuing to trend sub 4%, now is an affordable time to purchase a property. The Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting. Frequently, the cost of a mortgage + property taxes + association fees are less than the monthly cost of rent! Contact the Federal Savings Bank, a veteran owned bank, to learn more about mortgages.

Additionally, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens contributes vocals to two songs. The album's title comes from the 1986 film Parting Glances in which Steve Buscemi portrays a gay man navigating the difficulties of being in a relationship in Reagan-era New York. More than just identifying with the story, Schneit is interested in the in the lasting effect of the parting glances we share with strangers in our everyday encounters. She explains \"You see all sorts of physical and emotional traits on the train. From people puking, making out, screaming, crying, laughing, dancing, grooming, etc. We encounter each other in the thick of our complex lives by simply looking at each other all the time. These glances are mundane and fleeting but also powerfully intimate.\" The lingering impact of those brief moments seeps into the details and imagery she delivers with energizing hooks and a disarming lack of pretense on Parting Glances.TURBOBITorHITFILEorNITROFLAREAir Waves - Parting Glances (2015) - High Speed Download00 voted Torrents search, please waitYou may also like: Steve Kuhn : Life\u2019s Backward Glances\u2013Solo and Quartet (2008) FlacNightnoise - The Parting Tide (1990)Bad Habits - Parting Words [EP] (2013)Steve Khan - Parting Shot (2011) 320kbpsAt Daybreak - A Boxed Diorama Of The Parting Seas [EP](2010)Steve Kuhn - Life's Backward Glances (2008) InformationWould you like to leave your comment?

Whether you are debating or merely observing a debate about religion or politics, these two topics have to be the most draining. It was a bit like that this week reading the social media spew following the Liberal Party spill. Going by the letters to the editor and the online commentary, the issue of Syrian refugees is a topic that like no other manages to nullify empathy and decency. Reading some of the bile that people write can be truly depressing. Then we have our own Sunshine Coast councillors squabbling about overtime fees passed on to funeral directors by the council should families grieve too long by their loved ones' graveside. \"It's user pays. The funeral director doesn't have to pass it on,\" half of the councillors tried to defensively spout. I have to ask myself, at what point in life do you stop hearing what you are actually saying? Do they know what they sound like? Thankfully, my faith was restored, first when a majority of councillors voted to waive two funeral overtime fees, and, more importantly, when a local man phoned the paper during the week after reading the story of a local Lyme disease sufferer in need of a new wheelchair. \"I'll pay for it, but I don't want anyone to know it was me,\" the man said. That was it. No agenda, no big-noting himself, just a thoroughly decent man doing decent things.

Rollins has been unable to hit or play the field in five games this week because of a tender right index finger. Meanwhile Seager is batting .448 with an on-base percentage of.568 through his first nine major league games. He went 4 for 4 with a home run and stole a base in the Dodgers\u2019 win Saturday. He\u2019s reached base in all nine of his plate appearances the last two days. Once Rollins returns, however, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said the plan for Seager \u201calways has been to play him some at short and give Jimmy days, give (Justin Turner) days at third. He\u2019s played more than we thought from the standpoint of injuries and he\u2019s done a good job. While he\u2019s been praised for his defense and leadership, Rollins also ranks last among qualified National League shortstops in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage (.279). The 36-year-old is available to pinch run, but hasn\u2019t been cleared to bat or play the field. Mattingly said there\u2019s no timetable for Rollins to return. Seager, meanwhile, continues to impress. His home run was the second-hardest hit by a Dodger this season at 110 mph. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t make me nervous,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cHe\u2019s got that (Adrian Gonzalez) heartbeat. It\u2019s slow. He\u2019ll live to be 108, I bet.\u201d Mattingly has shunned any questions about potential playoff roster scenarios so far. But with the Dodgers\u2019 magic number to clinch the division nearing single digits (14), the battle for the final NLDS roster spots will soon be a main focal point of the season. Even if he doesn\u2019t supplant Rollins as the starting shortstop this season, Seager could still make an impact as a reserve. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be really good,\u201d Mattingly said, \u201cand he is really good.\u201d Puig not in the house Why isn\u2019t Yasiel Puig at Chase Field? Good question. \u201cI expected him to be here, honestly,\u201d Mattingly said. Puig is rehabbing a strained right hamstring at Camelback Ranch in nearby Glendale. He hasn\u2019t played since Aug. 27. While the team hasn\u2019t reported any setbacks in Puig\u2019s rehab, \u201che\u2019s not working out on the field; he\u2019s working out in water and the Alter-G.\u201d As baseball activities go, Puig isn\u2019t doing any less than pitcher Brandon McCarthy, for one, who\u2019s out for the season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. But McCarthy is with his teammates in the clubhouse and the dugout during games. Puig, who\u2019s rehabbing a half-hour away, is not. \u201cEverybody\u2019s invited,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is he\u2019s welcome.\u201d Mattingly said that Puig will return to Los Angeles with the team when it flies home tomorrow night. Also Kik\u00e9 Hernandez (strained left hamstring) ran on the field prior to the game. \u2026 Howie Kendrick (strained left hamstring) will get 10 at-bats Monday and Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in live batting practice. He is still unable to run at full speed, though \u201chis time was pretty good, faster than the day before,\u201d according to Mattingly. \u2026 Condolences to the family of Dodger Stadium chef Dave Pearson, who died at age 75.

Speaking at an event at Facebook's Menlo Park, California, headquarters that was streamed live online, Zuckerberg acknowledged that \"like\" isn't always appropriate for some posts \u2014 about a tragic news event, for example \u2014 when people might want to express empathy. Zuckerberg said the company, however, has veered away from making a \"dislike\" button, which could be used to vote down other people's posts. He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does. ___ Online: Highlights of Zuckerberg's Q&A: http:\\/\\/bit.ly\\/1W1dCam", "title": "Facebook ready to test button that goes beyond 'like'", "media-type": "News", "source": "Waterloo\\/Cedar Falls Courier", "published": "2015-09-16T01:11:07Z"}, {"id": "fe6e8fcc-1128-4410-923d-f05c42174336", "content": "a0 Tags: a0a0 a0News: Software a0a0a0a0a0|a0a0a0a0a0 AEX:WKL a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0This was published: 17 Sep 2015 - 06:27 pm a0a0a0a0&nbsp Tweet a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0&nbsp An early glimpse at the income tax picture for 2016 is now available from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. The new information includes estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of Labor. Inflation Adjustments - Background Since the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over 50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. Media Assistance Expert analysis plus additional details regarding the following projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. For interview requests, please contact Laura Gingiss ( laura.gingiss@wolterskluwer.com ), 847-267-2213 or Eric Scott ( eric.scott@wolterskluwer.com ), 847-267-2179. Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : Projections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the 12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax filings. For example: Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2015 and 2016. A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for 2016. The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at $1,050 for 2016. The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers. Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016: The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015. The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the taxpayer's taxable income. Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015. For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015. For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, up from $41,700 in 2015. The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts. The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal portability election can now effectively protect double that amount against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016). The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for 2016, up from $100,800 for 2015. The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015. Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US 2016 Tax Projections * As cited earlier, Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projections for indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the U.S. Department of Labor. The IRS usually releases official numbers by December each year. Tax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year.

There is scant evidence that taking calcium supplements prevents fractures and no evidence that increasing calcium through the diet prevents fractures or breaks either, experts said. The research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), collected data from dozens of studies on the issue. According to the NHS, adults need 700mg of calcium a day. It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. The NHS Choices website warns that taking high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. It says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. In the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. \"Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents fractures,\" they said. They said calcium supplements have \" an unfavourable risk:benefit profile\", meaning they could do more harm than good. \"Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with calcium supplements or through dietary sources.\" The experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. In an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. \"The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,\" he said. Professor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said: \"There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. \"However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men.\"", "title": "Calcium supplements 'have little effect on bone health'", "media-type": "News", "source": "Jersey Evening Post", "published": "2015-09-29T22:30:49Z"}, {"id": "61cfef77-ace5-4ffb-9387-bce11643414c", "content": "Indianapolis, Indiana (PRWEB) September 15, 2015 TinderBox, a leader in sales productivity technologies, launched its new TinderBox Signals alerting tool today, expanding the company\u2019s capability to create and automate email and mobile alerts that identify when customers interact with sales proposals, contracts and presentations.

Dharisha Bastiansa0reporting from GenevaThe United Nations Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein has called for the setting up of a special \u2018hybrid court\u2019 comprising international judges and prosecutors after a report by his Office revealed \u201chorrific\u201d violations strongly indicating that war crimes were most likely committed by both government forces and the LTTE and declared the country\u2019s justice system incapable of dealing with the seriousness of the crimes.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights yesterday released the long awaited report of an investigation by his office, into allegations that war crimes had been committed during the final stages of the Sri Lankan conflict.Indiscriminate shelling, extra judicial killings, enforced disappearances, \u201charrowing accounts\u201d of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes had been laid bare in the report, the UN High Commissioner said.As he made the 261 page report public, Zeid said Sri Lanka\u2019s justice system was not up to the task of dealing with such grave violations.\u201cThe inescapable reality is that Sri Lanka\u2019s criminal justice system is not ready to handle these types of crimes,\u201d High Commissioner Zeid told a news conference at the Palais des Nations in Geneva yesterday. Zeid said the report had highlighted \u201cyears of denials and coverups\u201d, the failure to carry out investigations and reprisals against those calling for justice. The High Commissioner said that domestic mechanisms of the past had suffered \u2018repeated failures\u201d to bring justice to victims, leading to skepticism, anger and mistrust on the part of victims. \u201cMany of the structures responsible for the violations and crimes remain in place,\u201d the High Commissioner noted.The hybrid special court would deepen national importance while at the same time maintain international focus on Sri Lanka, High Commissioner Zeid explained.The commitment by the new Government to pursue accountability through a domestic process was commendable, Zeid said, adding that \u201cunfortunately, Sri Lanka\u2019s criminal justice system is not yet ready\u201d.The High Commissioner told reporters that the absence of reliable witness protection, the inadequacy of the country\u2019s legal framework and the \u201cdegree to which the country\u2019s security sector and judicial system had been corrupted by decades of emergency, conflict and impunity\u201d posed challenges to achieving justice for victims.The High Commissioner noted that the investigation had been hindered by the fact that the Sri Lankan Government did not support the probe for almost entire length of the inquiry.\u201cWe were hampered by the inability to access the very people we needed to meet the most - victims in Sri Lanka,\u201d Zeid said.Hailing victims and survivors for the courage of their testimony that contributed to the 261 page, two-part report, the UN High Commissioner said he hoped the report would inspire change that many Sri Lankans had been \u201caching\u201d for.\u201cSri Lanka will never escape the stinging tentacles of its past unless victims receive justice and redress,\u201d the UN Rights Chief told journalists.The High Commissioner said he hoped the UN Human Rights Council which is sitting in its 30th Session this month, will endorse the recommendations in the report. In response to a question posed by Daily FT about whether his office would urge the inclusion of the hybrid court in the draft resolution on Sri Lanka at the end of the session, Zeid said consultations on the draft were not yet underway.I will expect that there will be a careful reading of the report the shorter summary and the longer report. My hope is that the Human Rights Council will endorse the recommendations we have placed in our report. Since we have not had consultations on the draft yet, it is a discussion to come. Our hope is that the recommendation will be accepted and adopted by principally by the Government of Sri Lanka but that the Human Rights Council will see fit to support the recommendations,\u201d he said.Zeid strongly recommended vetting for security and military officials from Sri Lanka proposed for international peacekeeping missions or military exchanges. \u201cIt is absolutely clear given the findings in this report that there must be a great deal of soul-searching if the Sri Lanka is going to ensure non-recurrence. One would hope that within the security services, there will be a recognition that these methods were they to be proven in a court of law, do not bring greater stability to a country. It only brings more suffering and creates more victims,\u201d the High Commissioner said.The High Commissioner took pains to note that the investigation carried out by his office was a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation. But he said it marked the beginning of a judicial process to confirm that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed by state actors and the LTTE and paramilitary groups during the Sri Lankan war.Zeid said his office hoped this report would lead to efforts to end impunity for these crimes and create \u201ca most intense reckoning with the past.\u201d\u201cThe recognition that there are simply too many families throughout Sri Lanka that have suffered appallingly, too many who have disappeared, too many pushed into exile, too many funerals organised, too much pain felt and too much lost in terms of Sri Lanka\u2019s human and economic potential, for the past not to be stared down, not to be learnt from and atoned for,\u201d the High Commissioner said.The OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) conducted by a team of seven investigators and three special advisors, found evidence of extra-judicial killings and indiscriminate shelling by Government forces with the use of long range weapons. The report said investigators also found evidence that top LTTE commanders had prevented civilians from leaving the battle zones in the Northern Province and said the Tigers had repeatedly set up military fortifications near civilian areas and medical facilities. In a particularly interesting finding, the OISL report revealed that it had documented extensive recruitment of children in armed conflict by the LTTE which intensified during the final months of the conflict. The OISL also found that the Karuna group had recruited children after its split from the LTTE in 2004.\u201cBased on the information gathered by OISL there are reasonable grounds to believe that Government security forces may have known that the Karuna group recruited children in areas under their control,\u201d the report states.The findings, if proven amount to a contravention of the UN convention on rights of the child and its optional protocol and would constitute a war crime if proven in a court of law, the report said.As the High Commissioner issued his statement about the release of the report, victim families from North, East and South of Sri Lanka sat outside Press Room III of the Palais des Nations, watching his remarks on the live webcast. Zeid acknowledged the women as he left the press room following his news conference. Govt. assures \u2018due attention\u2019 to UN war crimes report In what the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Spokesman Rupert Colville called a \u201ccordial response\u201d, the Government of Sri Lanka replied the OISL report, noting that it was not a criminal investigation and pledging to give it \u201cdue attention\u201d.The communiqu\u00e9 expresses the Government\u2019s commitment to ensuring non-recurrence and pledges wide consultations with stakeholders and victims.The following is the full text of the Government\u2019s response to the UN report.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka presents its compliments to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and with reference to the latter\u2019s Note dated 10 September 2015 conveying an unedited advance copy of the Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (A\\/HRC\\/30\\/61) and the Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) (A\\/HRC\\/30\\/SRP.2) has the honour to submit the following comments:The Government of Sri Lanka,*Takes note of the Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (A\\/HRC\\/30\\/61), and the recommendations made by the High Commissioner;*Is pleased and encouraged by the High Commissioner\u2019s recognition of the efforts of the new Government since the Presidential election of 8 January 2015 in dealing with issues of concern for the people of Sri Lanka relating to human rights, rule of law, governance, justice, institutional and legal reform and reconciliation;*Appreciates the due recognition given to the Government\u2019s constructive engagement with the High Commissioner and OHCHR aimed at addressing post-conflict issues that impact on achieving reconciliation;*Remains firm in its conviction to take all possible measures to ensure non-recurrence in keeping with the mandate given by the people of the country twice this year, 2015, at the Presidential election in January and the Parliamentary election in August;*Will ensure dialogue and wide consultations with all stakeholders especially the victims of conflict, communities, political parties, civil society representatives, the military as well as the High Commissioner and his Office, bilateral partners, and other international organistions in putting in place mechanisms and measures that will facilitate the right to know, right to justice, reparations and guaranteeing non-recurrence with the aim of achieving reconciliation and durable peace to ensure long-term progress of all her citizens;*Takes note also of the Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), recognises fully that this Report represents a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation, and will ensure that its content as well as recommendations receive due attention of the relevant authorities including the new mechanisms that are envisaged to be set up;*Remains open to continuing its engagement with the High Commissioner and his Office as well as the systems and procedures of the Human Rights Council, aimed at taking steps to safeguard and uphold the human rights of all her citizens.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the assurances of its highest consideration. TNA hails report; calls for introspection within Tamil community The Tamil National Alliance strongly welcomed the OISL report released yesterday, particularly the report\u2019s recommendation for the establishment of a hybrid court and the incorporation of international crimes into Sri Lanka\u2019s laws so that prosecutions could take place. TNA Lawmaker and Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily FT at the Palais des Nations in Geneva that the party hoped the Government would accept the UN report.Sumanthiran said the Foreign Minister in his address to the Human Rights Council this week had noted that that there was a new Sri Lanka in which things would be different.\u201cSri Lanka must now stand up and accept this report and work with the world community. To that extent, we ask the 47 Member States in the Human Rights Council to adopt all the recommendations in the OISL report as a resolution. We ask the Government of Sri Lanka to agree to that so that we can go forward with one aim. To deal with the past properly, in a manner that will assuage the feelings of the victims and having dealt with the past in a meaningful way to move forward into a bright future for all of Sri Lanka\u2019s people,\u201d the TNA Parliamentarian urged.He also urged soul-searching within the Tamil community, about the community\u2019s own failures. \u201cWe ask the Tamil people of Sri Lanka also to use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own community\u2019s failures and create the right culture and atmosphere in which we can live with dignity and self-respect, as equal citizens of Sri Lanka,\u201d Sumanthiran said.

Jersey City Police responding to the report of an aggravated assault at a car wash on Broadway at around noon quickly identified and arrested the two men, and also recovered a loaded handgun and drugs, Morrill said. Johnny Rojas, 33, of Romaine Avenue, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, terroristic threats, possession of a handgun, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. Alexis Diaz, 33, of Duncan Avenue, was charged with possession of a handgun, terroristic threats, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. The victim, a 26-year-old Griffith Street resident, told police two men approached him while he was washing a black SUV and asked him the whereabouts of his cousin, whom they claimed owed them money, Morrill said. Rojas and Diaz then attempted to punch the man, with Rojas lifting his shirt and showing a black handgun to the victim. The Griffith Street man then fled to the entrance of the business and called police, Morrill said. The man provided a description of his attackers to a police dispatcher, as well as the white Infiniti they fled the scene in. Plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit who were working in the area, as well as West District patrol, responded to the Romaine Avenue address to which the vehicle was registered, Morrill. Police saw the vehicle parked at the home and eventually spotted Rojas and a third individual, Hector Poll-Ortiz, walking on Broadway. When officers approached the two men, they saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Rojas' waistband, Morrill said. When one officer yelled \"gun,\" Rojas attempted to turn around and flee but was forced to the ground. A loaded, black Remington semi-automatic handgun was recovered from Rojas, who was also in possession of $468 in cash and the keys to the Infiniti, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Diaz was spotted walking nearby with cuts on his hand. Due to the proximity of the crime location and the apprehension of Rojas, officers detained Diaz, who was later identified as the second attacker from the car wash. While the car was being impounded, officers found six bags of suspected CDS cocaine in the cup holder in the middle console, Morrill said.

Berra won a record 10 championship rings, and the one he wore most often in later years was from 1953. It had the number 5 on its face -- with the lower part of the numeral encircling a diamond -- to signify the Yankees' fifth title in a row. Berra said he wore that ring because no other team, before or since, had accomplished that feat. Berra had 71 hits in the World Series, a record, and nine of them came against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956. He hit a grand slam off Don Newcombe in the Yankees' Game 2 loss, went 5 for 15 over the next four games, and then hit two more home runs off Newcombe in Game 7. Berra drilled two-run home runs in the first and the third innings, propelling the Yankees to a 9-0 victory. It was a bitter end to a dream season for Newcombe, who was 27-7 and won the Cy Young Award (then given to only one pitcher in the majors) and the NL Most Valuable Player Award. When Newcombe came to bat after the second home run, Berra consoled him from behind the plate. \"I hit a pretty good pitch, Newk,\" Berra told him, according to an account in The New York Times. \"Yes, you did,\" Newcombe replied. Berra remains the only player to hit two home runs in a winner-take-all World Series game, and his 10 runs batted in and .800 slugging percentage in 1956 were career highs in his 14 Series appearances. But the car presented to the World Series MVP went to Don Larsen for his perfect game in Game 5. It was Berra, though, who gave us an indelible snapshot of that moment by leaping into Larsen's arms after the final out. The unforgettable image of spontaneous joy defined the boyish enthusiasm for baseball that Berra kept all his life.

The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor revealed that it detained seven of the 24 prisoners held in segregation for more than six months across England's high-security jails as of June 1 this year. Whitemoor prison near March, Cambridgeshire Inspectors said a staffing \"merry-go-round\" meant inexperienced staff were needed to work on the segregation unit and management was \"poor\". Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated - kept away from other inmates - for up to 72 hours before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, to prevent danger to other prisoners or as punishment for disruptive behaviour. The IMB cited a United Nations protocol which defines solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day as torture and said m any inmates in segregation at the Cambridgeshire jail were often confined for longer. The report, covering the year to May 2015, said: \"Although often faced with challenging prisoners, requiring officers to get into and out of personal protection equipment, on most days staff were able to offer a full regime. \"It was not however unusual for some curtailment to be necessary, meaning that residents might miss showers, corporate worship, phone calls and exercise. At its worst, for example on 10 occasions in April, the Seg (segregation unit) had to be locked down.\" The regime in place was \"much the same\" as that which HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in 2011 to be \"inadequate\", inspectors added. \"One of the other problems noted by Inspectors was the poor management arrangements for the Seg. Whilst there have been definite improvements, with greater adherence to procedures and standards, and consistency of decision-making, new prison-wide staffing arrangements meant that the custody manager responsible for the Seg was more frequently away from the unit, for example acting as orderly officer, managing detail or on nights,\" the report said. \" We do not blame Whitemoor managers for this merry go-round, which results from centrally-imposed staffing norms.\" A high-profile terrorist prisoner recently won a legal challenge at the UK's highest court against his segregation at HMP Whitemoor. Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian who is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot, was segregated for extended periods. The Supreme Court ruled in July his confinement, for periods or more than a month, was unlawful beyond the initial 72-hour period.

Ronald Joseph Carrari, 56, is charged with making criminal threats and resisting arrest stemming from the March 20 incident. His sister, Christina Carrari, had called the Sheriff's Department to report that he had threatened her. Four deputies responding to the report went to Ronald Carrari's house south of Los Alamos, where he refused to come out of the house because the deputies did not have a warrant. Two of the responding deputies testified Friday that Ronald Carrari had said he was going to get his guns. \"I heard him say, 'You got your guns, I'm getting mine,'\" Deputy Jonathan Fleming said. However, Fleming and Deputy Bobby Fortier also testified that they had actually seen him holding a gun. A search of his home yielded eight guns, including one that is apparently illegal under California law, a Taurus handgun that fires .410 shotgun shells, making it a short-barreled shotgun. At some point during the incident, Ronald Carrari, audibly upset, called 911, expressing fear that deputies were going to kill him and saying that the Sheriff's Department had a \"vendetta\" against him. After being arrested under suspicion of making criminal threats and resisting arrest, Ronald Carrari bailed out of jail. He was rearrested after being accused of threatening his sister again several days later. The two incidents apparently stemmed from Christina Carrari limiting the hours that her brother could visit their ailing mother, although Ronald Carrari had a history of not getting along with other members of the family, and his father and his developmentally disabled brother had recently obtained restraining orders against him. Christina Carrari testified that her brother was allowed to visit their mother between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., which she said were \"her best hours.\" Other family members were not subject to the visitation hours. Christina Carrari testified that this was due to Ronald Carrari's prior behavior. \"He was upsetting mom as well as wreaking havoc with all of us,\" she said. Their mother died March 18. The second incident in which Ronald Carrari is accused of threatening his sister occurred at a memorial service for their mother. Ronald Carrari allegedly placed a memorial planter box with threatening messages written on it outside of the Union Hotel, where the service was being held.a0 Testimony will continue Wednesday morning.", "title": "Deputies testify in trial of Los Alamos standoff suspect", "media-type": "News", "source": "Santa Ynez Valley News", "published": "2015-09-05T01:00:00Z"}, {"id": "eb497d2c-aa44-48bc-a1b5-e691b773b469", "content": "The Asus MG279Q is one of two models in this roundup - the other is the Acer XB270HU - to use in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The other monitors use twisted nematic (TN) panels, which have inferior viewing angles.Hence, if viewing angles are your biggest concern, you should be looking at these two models.The Acer and the Asus differ mainly in the variable refresh rate technology used. Asus supports AMD FreeSync, while Acer uses Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The variable refresh rate range on the Asus is between 35Hz and 90Hz. This is not as wide as the Acer (30Hz to 144Hz) and the BenQ XL2730Z (40Hz to 144Hz). However, it is probably adequate as most games should be running at frame rates within this range. If your games fall outside this range, you can probably tweak their graphics settings to bring them back within the range to benefit from FreeSync.Physically, the monitor is fairly slim, with a 13mm-wide bezel.Overall, my impression is that the monitor is not overly loud and should appeal to non-gamers too.You can pivot the Asus 90 degrees for a portrait orientation or swivel it by up to 60 degrees to its sides. It has a pair of built-in speakers and two USB 3.0 ports at the bottom rear of the display.Navigate the on-screen display (OSD) settings with a joystick. The monitor includes six predefined settings, or profiles, that are optimised for different usage modes, from watching movies to playing a first-person shooter game.A demo feature helps you decide whether the selected profile is suitable. It splits the screen into two, with one half showing the original display setting and the other the chosen profile, so that you can see both side by side. A crosshair overlay can be turned on to help gamers aim in shooting games.Screen brightness topped out at 270 nits, making it one of the brightest models I have tested. However, colour accuracy was average with a score of 3 out of 5 compared to 4.5 for the Acer. Several handy features for gamersGamers will like this BenQ XL2730Z monitor. Not only does it support AMD FreeSync for a smooth gaming experience (with a compatible AMD graphics card), but also it has a number of features that cater to gamers.For example, you can hang your headset on a retractable hook at the left of the display. A carry handle makes it easier to take the monitor to LAN gaming parties.You can plug your headset into the monitor, as it has headphone and microphone jacks. On-screen display (OSD) settings let gamers adjust the headset volume or mute the headset microphone.The BenQ's screen can pivot 90 degrees to a portrait orientation. It lets you swivel 45 degrees to the sides - more limited than other monitors I've tried. The monitor comes with a unique feature that I find useful. The OSD settings can be adjusted using an external controller dubbed the S Switch. The wired round puck, which comes with large buttons and a scroll wheel, fits neatly into a circular indent at the base of the monitor stand.I find the S Switch easier to use than traditional OSD buttons on other monitors. You can also save up to three different sets of display settings, and switch quickly between them using the S Switch.Gaming-centric features include a Black Equalizer mode, which attempts to brighten dark areas of the screen so that you can spot concealed enemies more easily during a game. There is also a motion-blur reduction feature that helps reduce the amount of smearing during fast action games.But both features have their downsides. The Black Equalizer mode makes everything look overexposed and affects colour accuracy. Turning on blur reduction leads to a reduction in screen brightness. So use them with discretion.The AMD FreeSync feature on this BenQ monitor works for refresh rates from 40Hz to 144Hz - the widest range among the three AMD FreeSync monitors in this round-up. Its closest rival is the Asus MG279Q, which has a FreeSync range of 35Hz to 90Hz.The viewing angle is decent, but not as wide as on monitors that use in-plane switching display technology. Nevertheless, the BenQ's twisted nematic screen has good colour accuracy - as long as you do not use its Black Equalizer mode. Lower screen resolution is a letdownThe biggest flaw in this Philips monitor is its 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution. While this resolution is adequate for a 24-inch monitor, it is not good enough for a 27-inch display. In comparison, the other monitors in this roundup have screen resolutions of at least 2,560 x 1,440 pixels.To be fair, the lower screen resolution may be useful for gamers with less powerful computers. They can run games smoothly at the native resolution without having to reduce their graphics settings. On the other hand, the Philips monitor does not look as sharp as its rivals when it comes to browsing the Internet or reading a document.Viewing from the sides and the bottom is poor, though not unexpected, given that this monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel instead of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. There is one upside though: TN screens usually have low response time and input lag. As a result, games, especially first-person shooters, feel responsive.Philips has tried to inject a bit of flair into the design. The display has a red strip in front and its stand has an opening for cables to pass through. You can rotate the screen by 90 degrees to portrait orientation, and swivel the display to the right or left by 65 degrees.However, the bezel looks chunky at around 25mm at the top and 20mm at the sides. A laptop-style external power brick is required. Like most Nvidia G-Sync monitors, the Philips monitor has a single DisplayPort connector. There are no HDMI or DVI inputs. But there is an integrated USB hub with four USB 3.0 ports at the back.Touch-sensitive buttons operate the on-screen display settings. The settings are fairly basic with no profiles for specific tasks.There is an option to display a crosshair on the screen to help players in first-person shooter games. But this lone gamer feature feels like a token gesture.In my test with a colourimeter, the Philips covered 99 per cent of the sRGB colour space. Colour accuracy was decent, but not as good as some of its competitors.At $999, the Philips is one of the least expensive Nvidia G-Sync monitors in the market, though AMD FreeSync models are around the same price.However, the IPS-based Acer XB270HU arguably provides better value despite being more expensive at $1,099. Friendly price tag but there's a catchOf the five monitors in this round-up, Samsung U28E590DS is the only model with an ultra high-definition (also known as 4K) resolution. Its rivals have a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels or fewer.Yet, it is one of the more affordable monitors at $899. Only the BenQ XL2730Z is cheaper ($888).But there is a catch. The Samsung monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel with viewing angles that are not as wide as other displays based on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The bottom viewing angle is especially bad, with significant colour shift.Samsung has tried to remedy this inherent weakness in TN displays with an image enhancement feature dubbed Samsung Magic Angle. This feature offers five different profiles, each designed to alleviate the poor viewing angles of the display for specific scenarios. For instance, Group View is intended for multiple viewers while Lean Back tries to improve the viewing experience when looking at the display from below.In practice, Magic Angle works pretty well - so much so that I could almost forget that this is a monitor with a TN display.The Samsung scored well in our colour accuracy test. I also like that it comes with a joystick for users to adjust the on-screen display settings. It is easier to use than the usual buttons.However, you will need a high-end gaming system to get the most out of this monitor. Unlike its rivals, the Samsung has a very limited FreeSync range (40 to 60Hz). This means that unless your game is running between 40 and 60 frames per second, it will not benefit from FreeSync. To achieve such consistent frame rates in the latest games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels requires a powerful computer, such as one with dual graphics cards.It is not a deal-breaker if you have a high-end system, but keep this in mind if you are buying the monitor solely for the FreeSync feature. Other flaws that may put you off: The monitor lacks pivot and swivel functionality and it also has no USB ports.", "title": "IPS gaming monitor has great viewing angles", "media-type": "News", "source": "Straits Times", "published": "2015-09-15T21:00:00Z"}, {"id": "40f54607-95e8-4d19-a385-5ac544984d5e", "content": "Reverse-Christianity responsible.

Registration for the Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC) is now open for teams of 7-12th grade students through December 4. TARC is the U.S. aerospace and defense industry\u2019s flagship program designed to encourage students to pursue study and careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Structured to emulate the aerospace industry's design, fabrication and testing process, TARC requires teams to build and fly a model rocket that meets challenging design requirements and precise targets for altitude and flight duration. Each year, TARC's rules and scoring parameters change to challenge the students' ingenuity and encourage a fresh approach to rocket design. This year's rules require teams to build and launch a rocket carrying two raw eggs to 850 feet and return them to Earth unbroken within a flight duration of 44 to 46 seconds. A new requirement this year calls for the eggs to be placed perpendicularly to each other, thus complicating how teams protect the eggs in flight. Damaged eggs disqualify the flight. The 100 top-scoring teams from across the country will be invited to compete in the National Finals in Washington D.C. next spring.

These contractors often knock on homeowners' doors and say they need a new roof or siding due to wind and hail damage \u2013 all cosmetic damage repairs that may not be necessary. Fixing it may help a home look better, but it won't function better. Home insurance companies often classify dents, dimples and dings in roof vents, shingles or aluminum siding as \"cosmetic damage\" to a property, says Billy Van Jura, an insurance broker in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. \"When several claims for this type of work are submitted in a single region, the price everyone pays (including those who haven't filed a claim) can increase because the insurer sees the region as having greater risk of additional claims,\" an article at realtor.com\u00ae cautions. \"There's nothing you can do about a widespread storm that damages several homes in your area and ultimately raises everyone's rates.\" However, \"you can help curb your own annual home insurance costs with a little-known option called 'cosmetic damage exclusion.\" The American Association of Insurance Services created the cosmetic damage exclusion in 2013. Its goal is to protect consumers from scammers and attempt to keep home insurance rates more affordable by making cosmetic damage coverage optional. Homeowners can then decide if they want to pay for cosmetic-only wind and hail damage. If the damage impacts the safety or structural functionality of the home, the home insurance policy kicks in. By adding this exclusion to cosmetic damage, homeowners stand to save money on their annual premiums \u2013 anywhere from $100 to $200 or more, says Troy Thompson, an independent insurance broker with Pinnacle Insurance Agency in Coon Rapids, Minn. Hail and wind damage claims alone contribute to about 40 percent of all home insurance claims in the last five years, according to the Insurance Information Institute. And many of those claims may be for minor cosmetic repairs, such as a few nicks in the siding that homeowners may be told are more urgent than they actually are. Homeowners who remain covered for cosmetic damage may submit a claim, but they may also have to pay applicable deductibles, insurance agents say.

While Pluto was in Retrograde it helped us connect to ourselves in a deep dark way. It put us through harsh lessons and forced us to deal with issues around what empowers or disempowers us from the inside out. We have been shown and made to deal with issues around our own personal power in some very important areas of our lives, such as with money, our health, jobs and relationships!Hopefully, we have learned down this darker path more about our shadow-self and what we are truly deeply passionate about and obsessed over. This Pluto Retrograde phase forced us to look at our behaviors and patterns, through some hard lesson and learn what we do that hurts us and take our power away!Ask yourself what you are allowing to steal your joy? What are you doing or not doing to take care of yourself, in one way or another? This is all about what part of our lives have been the most challenging over the last 5 months, and what's situations made us feel like we had no control or power in. We've also probably either experienced what makes us feel powerful and back in control, or at the very least have an idea of what will help us to change. Over these last 5 months we've had to learn how to be honest with who we are and embrace all of who we are, the good, bad and ugly!Now is the time to prove what we can do, and let go of any habits, behaviors, or fears that have held us back from fully being living our true potential. Whatever you've been through or learned during this Pluto Retrograde phase about your passion, inner strength or souls path...is now ready to be realized out in the world. The deep connection we made with ourselves over these last 5 months has been a learning experience, to help you be more authentic with yourself. Get back out there and work on your long-term goals, that align more so with what you truly want!Pluto will continue to move slowly as it gets back to its normal pace through Oct. 8th.

We have a big heart. However, there is alimit to what we can do,\" President Joachim Gauck, a formerrights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech onSunday evening. \"Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don'tknow yet where those limits are,\" he added. The comments from the head of state, who has a largelyceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appearedto be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor AngelaMerkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. The government declined to respond directly to Gauck'scomments, reflecting political convention, but defended itshandling of the situation. \"The German government and the chancellor are convinced thatprotection has to be given to those who need it, whether theyare persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,\" saidgovernment spokesman Steffen Seibert. The debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylumseekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the EuropeanUnion from the Middle East and parts of Africa. Fourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl brokeout between two rival groups in a refugee center in the westernGerman town of Calden, police said. The refugees were beinghoused in tents set up on a disused airfield. A union representing German police officers has suggestedthat refugees should be divided according to their religion totry to reduce the risk of conflict. Germany has reintroduced border controls with EU neighborsto try to regulate the flow of people after initially throwingopen its doors to refugees from Syria. The central government also agreed last week to give its 16regional states around 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) next yearto help cover the cost of looking after refugees. \"The German government stands by its decision to nowintroduce signs of order into the process for the arrival andthe admission of refugees,\" Seibert added. Merkel's popularity has dropped sharply over her handling ofthe refugee crisis, two polls showed at the weekend, indicatinga shift in the mood in the Europe Union's most populous country.

Armed Interpol officers swooped on Joseph Tsang, who has been on the run since mid-August, after he was lured out of hiding with the promise of a date with a teenage girl on Friday night. This newspaper can also exclusively reveal that the 31-year-old claims he skipped Britain by disguising himself as a woman and using his sister\u2019s passport, raising alarming questions about security at Heathrow Airport. He told school friend Alex O\u2019Neill \u2013 who lives in Hong Kong \u2013 he was \u2018terrified\u2019 as he boarded a Hong Kong-bound flight and spent the flight with a hat over his face. Tsang started exchanging Facebook messages with O\u2019Neill and his girlfriend, Stephanie Velenzuela, soon after his escape. They visited him in his hideaway in a high-rise apartment block before deciding to contact The Mail on Sunday for help to turn him in. We put O\u2019Neill in touch with police in the UK and Hong Kong, but there was a tense week-long wait before an extradition order could be processed to enable Tsang\u2019s arrest. Finally, hours after the extradition order was approved in Hong Kong, Tsang was lured out of his hideaway after Stephanie, 22, texted him promising to bring a teenage friend to meet him at a local McDonald\u2019s. As he stepped out of a lift with O\u2019Neill, the armed team pounced, pinning him to the floor and handcuffing him when he tried to swing a punch at one officer to escape. Yesterday, Tsang was in a detention centre awaiting extradition to Britain, where he has been convicted of raping girls aged 14 and 15 and making indecent images of a child. Led away: Tsang wore a black hood as international police escorted him to a holding cell from which UK authorities will order his extradition The IT professional \u2013 an accomplished ice skater who in 2009 appeared alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean on ITV\u2019s Dancing On Ice \u2013 fled Britain last month just days before his second sex offences trial. He was convicted in his absence of two counts of rape and two counts of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl whom he groomed on Facebook before driving her to a hotel in Portsmouth in December 2011. In an earlier trial in January, Tsang was convicted of one count of making indecent images of children, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and three counts of sexual activity with a child. Oxford Crown Court heard he lured a 14-year-old girl to his home in Oxford in 2012 to sexually abuse and take photos of her. Escape: Tsang, left, claims he escaped the UK by using a passport belonging to his sister Josephine, right, and disguising himself as a woman Tsang absconded after he was released on bail with the condition he wear an electronic ankle tag and surrender his UK passport. When he fled, Tsang \u2013 who has dual nationality \u2013 entered Hong Kong using his electronic ID card. He initially planned to ask to serve his jail term in Hong Kong. \u2018He was desperate not to serve a jail term in the UK because he said he would be singled out and beaten up as a sex offender there,\u2019 O\u2019Neill said. However, when a lawyer in Hong Kong told him he must serve his term in the UK, Tsang considered fleeing to the nearby Chinese gambling resort of Macau, which has no UK extradition treaty, or slipping into Thailand on a false passport. He eventually decided to stay in hiding in Hong Kong and around ten days ago moved into an unfurnished 28th floor flat in the city\u2019s Ap Lei Chau district. Skater: Tsang is circled above in Dancing On Ice, which he appeared on in 2009 alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean O\u2019Neill \u2013 who makes a living selling electronic goods on eBay \u2013 said: \u2018Joey was a nice guy but when I saw him this time, he wasn\u2019t the guy I used to know. He seemed to have gone a bit crazy. When he spoke about the UK cases, he said he did have sex with the girls but insisted it wasn\u2019t rape.\u2019 Stephanie said: \u2018When we went to see him, he was always asking me for girls and looking at the girls on my Facebook page and saying, \u201cSet me up with her\u201d. He was creepy.\u2019 O\u2019Neill stayed in daily contact with police in the UK and Hong Kong as he continued visiting Tsang while an extradition order was drawn up. Tsang, meanwhile, grew increasingly paranoid, using binoculars to watch for police cars and monitoring the internet for news of the manhunt for him. Yesterday, Tsang appeared in a Hong Kong court where he was remanded in custody. A lawyer representing him said he would contest extradition. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood, for Oxford West and Abingdon, said last night: \u2018Tsang inflicted a living nightmare on his victims but ran like a coward when he faced justice. I want to thank The Mail on Sunday for their help. It is going to make a big difference to the victims.\u2019 A Home Office spokesman said Tsang\u2019s sister\u2019s passport was clean and therefore did not arouse suspicion at Heathrow because he was not on a flight risk database. She added: \u2018Ultimately it is an airline\u2019s responsibility to check a passport matches the person travelling.\u2019 A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: \u2018We do not comment on security matters.\u2019", "title": "Dancing On Ice skater rapist Joseph Tsang captured in Hong Kong honey trap", "media-type": "News", "source": "Mail Online UK", "published": "2015-09-26T23:44:12Z"}, {"id": "2cba2129-133f-42a0-b4b2-59491a7f3894", "content": "Seth Russell threw for 376 yards and five touchdowns and also ran for a score to help fourth-ranked Baylor open the season with a 56-21 victory at SMU on Friday night.The two-time defending Big 12 champion Bears finally got to start fresh after the long, long offseason that followed their playoff snub last season.SMU played its first game for new coach Chad Morris, Clemson's offensive coordinator the past four seasons.

The manager often explained this was because of the players he had and using a system that best suited their abilities. To some extent this season, he has either demonstrated a willingness to work with multiple systems or he feels he has more tactically astute players. Given the relative experience of the players he has now and the ones departed, you would surmise it is probably the latter. Cooper admitted on Saturday that a difference in formation is often as little as a five-yard tweak, but in the context of the win at Crewe, it was important. In the first half, Town started with a 4-2-3-1. James Brophy, making his second senior start, was pushed forward into the advanced left-wing position and Nicky Ajose was given the task on the right. It was not very successful. Brophy struggled to get forward as he too often had to help out Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, who was having a poor game against Ryan Colclough. Eventually, Brophy was moved into defence. With just two central midfielders to link play between attack and defence, Swindon actually struggled to dominate the ball. At half-time, the Town boss accepted he would not be able to control the midfield with the players he had available and instead opted to utilise his forwards' ability on the break. Ormonde-Ottewill\u2019s injury was a blessing in disguise. Brophy dealt much better with Colclough and Cooper used the opportunity to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with youngster Tom Smith coming on to provide more energy in midfield. Share article Though Town ceded control of midfield and spent more time defending, they looked a more potent attacking force with Nicky Ajose and Wes Thomas paired together up front. Chances came when they stretched Crewe\u2019s defence with balls in behind, but it was also the ability of the two strikers to harry their opponents and win the ball high up the pitch that created chances.", "title": "TALKING TACTICS: finding the right Plan B", "media-type": "News", "source": "Wiltshire Gazette and Herald", "published": "2015-09-07T04:30:00Z"}, {"id": "1dc28e33-bdd7-4a24-91b2-8f3150317282", "content": "This weekends High School Football features district openers for Victoria East and West.

All is well and my OB\\/GYN was thrilled to hear that I'm on WW and attending meetings. She said something that really struck me. She said, \"We are all a work in progress, my dear.\" So true. So that got me to thinking about September and the progress I want to see when the month comes to a close. In the past, that would have been easy. I would have picked some arbitrary \"lost this amount of weight\" number and set that as my goal. This time I around, I've learned. I need to find success and joy in more than the scale. I need to find it in new habits and my commitment to a way of life. That said, here are my commitments for September: 1) Stop stressing myself out on weigh-in days! I go to a Tuesday evening meeting after work. For weeks, I've struggled with trying to figure out how much I can eat and drink throughout the day so that it doesn't throw my weigh-in off. Do any of you struggle with this? This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. 2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles.

Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further\\/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard.

When Elementary returns this fall, Sherlock ( Jonny Lee Miller ) will be dealing with the aftermath of his relapse in last season's finale. One of the consequences? His father Morland Holmes, played by John Noble , is coming to New York to check up on his son. Morland is an international consultant who has a lot of power and has amassed a considerable fortune. \"He's someone who works from the shadows to help various governments and mega-corps and titans of industry make moves around the globe,\" creator Rob Doherty tells TVGuide.com. \"He has the ear of many important and wealthy and influential people. He has a personality that's very appropriate to that kind of work and those kinds of worlds: He's very stern, very calculating, extremely bright -- but that's probably not a big surprise. Like Sherlock, he's typically a few moves ahead of the people he works with and then [is] able to predict certain behaviors.\" Check out all this week's Mega Buzz! Whether or not the elder Holmes will try to apply those skills to his son remains to be seen, but Morland will stick his nose into Sherlock's first case back, which is loosely inspired by the canonical story, \"The Adventure of Wysteria Lodge.\" Guest star Patrick Page, whom we met in last season's finale, will reprise the role of Jonathan Bloom, a man with an unsavory history of preying on desperate women who then disappear. This time, however, Bloom will seek out Sherlock for help. \"Bloom insists that he is not responsible for the disappearance of at least one of the women,\" Doherty says. \"His wife vanished without a trace five years ago. He's always insisted that he's innocent. He's been in the tabloids quite a bit. So, he approaches Sherlock, engages him and wants Sherlock Holmes to prove that he's innocent of his wife's disappearance.\" Elementary returns for its fourth season on Thursday, Nov. 4 at 10\\/9c on CBS.

(InGoal photo by Scott Slingsby) Washington Capitals\u2019 netminder Justin Peters went under the knife on Monday, a procedure the club calleda0\u201csuccessful.\u201d In a brief news releasea0Washington said Peters underwent surgery on his left knee and they expected the 28-year old to be ready for training camp, though an official start date has not been announced. The Capitals first preseason game is against Florida on September 21st. Peters\u2019 agent Jordan Neumann told the Washington Posta0Peters had been rehabilitating a sore knee that did not improve as expected, so they opted for surgery. \u201cI would expect he\u2019s doing everything in full gear, taking shots prior to the start of training camp,\u201d Neumann said. \u201cWe expect him to be a full participant on day one of camp.\u201d Peters played just 12 games for Washington last season \u2013 his first with the club after joining from Carolina \u2013 going 3-6-1 with a .881 save percentage and 3.25 goals against average. The Blyth, Ontario native is entering the final seasona0of a two-year, one-way contract worth $950,000, and will be an unrestricted free agent next summer. he is expected to compete with German prospect Phillip Grubauer for the backup role behind recently re-signed No.1 Braden Holtby. Grubauer was selected ahead of Peters during the Eastern Conference quarter finals, when starter Braden Holtby was sidelined due to illness ahead of Game 2, and the 23-year old is considered a brighta0goaltending prospect. Grubauer\u2019s emergence and new one-way contracta0suggest Peters may be AHL bound this season, but a return in time for training camp will at least allow him to compete for the backup role after a disappointing first year with the club.

Job | For the Associated Press Updated 12:52PM Don\u2019t let the Pilot\u2019s new, sleek look fool you. Honda\u2019s largest sport utility vehicle is bigger than ever on the inside, particularly in its third-row seats. Revamped from roof to tires, the 2016 Pilot shed its boxy exterior and upgraded its interior while adding features and power and is now capable of generating 280 horsepower from its re-engineered and noticeably refined V-6 engine. It also shed weight, putting this more powerful Pilot at the top in fuel mileage among large three-row gasoline-powered 2016 SUVs. The front-wheel drive 2016 Pilot with a new nine-speed automatic transmission is rated by the federal government at 20 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. There\u2019s even a new top-of-the-line Pilot Elite that comes standard with 20-inch wheels, leather seats and spacious second-row captain\u2019s chairs, as well as the latest safety equipment and luxury-car features like a heated steering wheel. The starting manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, including destination charge, for the 2016 Pilot is $30,875 for a base LX model with front-wheel drive. The lowest starting retail price, including destination charge, for an all-wheel drive Pilot LX is $32,675. The new Elite model, which has standard all-wheel drive, is priced at $47,300. The Pilot\u2019s 3.5-liter V-6 engine adds direct injection to help boost horsepower by 30 over last year\u2019s model. Torque is increased by 9, to 262 foot-pounds at 4,700 rpm, and the test-driven model zoomed forward and merged into traffic with surprising ease. 2016 Honda Pilot AWD Elite BASE PRICE: $29,995 for FWD LX; $31,795 for AWD LX; $32,430 for FWD EX; $34,230 for AWD EX; $35,905 for FWD EX-L; $37,705 for AWD EX-L; $41,020 for FWD Touring; $42,820 for AWD Touring; $46,420 for AWD Elite. PRICE AS TESTED: $42,225. TYPE: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, seven-passenger, large sport utility vehicle. ENGINE: 3.5-liter, single overhead cam, direct injection V-6 with i-VTEC and variable cylinder management. MILEAGE: 19 mpg (city), 26 mpg (highway). TOP SPEED: NA. LENGTH: 194.5 inches. WHEELBASE: 111 inches. CURB WEIGHT: 4,317 pounds. BUILT AT: Lincoln, Ala. OPTIONS: None. DESTINATION CHARGE: $880. The Associated Press With the nine-speed transmission, which is only available on the Touring and Elite models and was in the test-driven Pilot Elite, the engine is surprisingly quiet and vibration-free. Lower trim levels get the carryover six-speed automatic, which reduces fuel mileage numbers by 1 mpg. It\u2019s easy for a driver to forget just how large the new Pilot is because at more than 16 feet long, it feels remarkably light. The lighter weight - now starting at just over 4,000 pounds - and stiffer structure make the 2016 Pilot feel solid and stable but not ponderous. The test-driven model was quiet inside and its supple leather seats and steering wheel wrap, soft-touch interior plastics, side-door sunscreens and 8-inch touchscreen display added to its luxurious feel. The big screen crisply displayed the view from the Pilot\u2019s backup camera. The Elite also comes standard with a panoramic roof and four USB ports, and passengers marveled that so many luxury features could come with a Honda SUV. The ride was comfortable, with the large SUV maintaining a smooth ride as it drove over bumps in the road. And its large, 20-inch wheels didn\u2019t transmit any heaviness to those inside. A new one-touch feature helps passengers get into the third-row seat. Just push a button and a second-row seat automatically tilts and slides to its forward-most position. The second-row seat then can return to its midpoint setting. The Pilot\u2019s third row is easier to access because the step-in is 1.2 inches lower and 2.5 inches wider than before. The third row also has a new, three-position recline feature, and the 38.9 inches of headroom back there is more than what\u2019s in the back seat of a Toyota Camry. The Pilot\u2019s 31.9 inches of third-row legroom can accommodate adults and surpasses what\u2019s in the Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander third rows. The 2016 Pilot can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Every model comes with six airbags, antilock brakes, brake-assist and electronic stability control. Top trim levels of Touring and Elite add the latest forward collision and lane departure warning and collision mitigation system, among other things. In July, 1,358 new Pilots were recalled because third-row seatbelts might be trapped between the seat and sideliner, making them difficult to use.", "title": "New Honda Pilot looks smaller, adds interior space", "media-type": "News", "source": "The Nashville Ledger", "published": "2015-09-10T17:52:06Z"}, {"id": "07847437-3ffe-42d5-9f8a-0bec86b4d706", "content": "Residents threw garbage at a United National Congress (UNC) entourage and chased its candidate Raziah Ahmed, former Senate President and acting President of T&T, out of Ramsaran Street, San Fernando yesterday during a walkabout in the marginal constituency of San Fernando West.

Adults can indulge in a variety of fine vintages, while children picnic and frolic in the wide-open fields. The gorgeous Sparkling Pointe Winery in Southold, Long Island is a particularly sweet destination for NYC families. Though it's less than two hours by car from Midtown Manhattan, it feels worlds away thanks to its grand opulence and wide selection of sparkling wines. And because it's just a short drive away from many other family attractions, including a working lighthouse and pick-your-own apples, you can make a fun day of it with the kids. The lovely patio overlooking the vineyard at Sparkling Pointe. Start your day with a bit of bubbly at Southold's Sparkling Pointe, the only winery in New York State that solely produces sparkling wines. Order by the glass or sample them all with a grand tasting flight, which is what I usually do (just make sure you have a designated driver).a0What makes this spot unique is its tasting house (not a room), which is sleek and trendy with Brazilian art adorning the walls and soothing piped-in music. Thanks to the large space and relaxed vibe, it's more of a cafe experience where you can linger, making it perfect for wine tasting with children in tow. Plop down on the low-slung couches around the fireplace or sit on the outdoor patio overlooking the grape vines in warm weather. A dedicated server pours each variety at your table, and you can purchase complementary snacks like locally made cheeses, charcuterie and chocolates that the kids are sure to gobble up. While Sparkling Pointe welcomes kids of all ages, it's smart to bring a small toy or book, or bust out your smartphone for fidgety tots. However, my 10-year-old is always content to sit quietly and savor the snacks. Opened in 2010, this winery is a popular stop on the Long Island wine trail, but if you visit soon after its 11am daily opening on a Saturday or Sunday, or any time on a weekday, you may get the place to yourself. RELATED: More Family-Friendly North Fork Wineries Climb to the top of the Horton Point Lighthouse for stunning views. After you've had your fill, the Horton Point Lighthouse is just a quick five-minute drive away. This working, 19th-century lighthouse has no age or height restrictions, so everyone in your family can try to climb to the top of the 58-foot tower, where you'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the town and the Long Island Sound. There's also a cute nautical museum with various artifacts. The lighthouse is open seasonally on weekends through Columbus Day, but the surrounding eight-acre park is accessible every day year-round. The apples are always within reach at Woodside Orchards. No North Fork autumn getaway is complete without a stop at a local farm. There are several apple-picking places in the area, but my family's favorite is Woodside Orchards in Aquebogue, about a 20-minute drive back toward the city. Woodside's semi-dwarf apple trees are only 10-feet high, so the fruit is low enough for even little kids to pluck right off the branches. Plus the adorable country store sells delicious cider, doughnuts, pies and other baked goods. RELATED: Best Pick-Your-Own Apple Farms on Long Island The ironically named Modern Snack Bar is steeped in nostalgia. Wrap up your day with dinner at Modern Snack Bar, an old-school diner opened way back in 1950. Only a few doors up the road from Woodside, it's easy to find, just look for the awesome retro neon sign. The decor is kitschy and the service friendly at this family-run eatery, which serves up comfort food staples like burgers, fries and shakes along with more sophisticated fare such as seafood entrees and roast Long Island duck. We always finish with slices of homemade pie. All photos courtesy of the respective establishments.

The greenback fell to 120.30 yen from 120.40 yen Tuesday in New York, and the euro rose to $1.1278 from $1.1272, while several battered emerging market currencies also gained. The single currency fell to 135.67 yen from 135.71 yen. Economists are split over whether the US central bank, at the end of a two-day meeting Thursday, will raise rates for the first time since 2006. Financial markets are pricing the likelihood of a hike at around 32 percent, Bloomberg News said, a sharp drop from before Beijing devalued the yuan in August when the majority of dealers expected a September move. While the Fed has signalled it will raise rates this year, the odds on a rise this month have dropped as concerns have mounted about slowing growth in China and its impact on the world economy. Takuji Okubo, chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, told AFP that if the market reaction to a rate hike is limited that would suggest the global economy is in better shape than expected. \u201cIt\u2019s not that a Fed hike itself is actually positive, but it (would mean) that the global economy isn\u2019t as vulnerable as people feared,\u201d Okubo said. \u201cThat could actually reduce uncertainty in the global economy. And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),\u201d he added. Asia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday. Higher rates would tend to strengthen the greenback, and could severely hurt emerging markets as investors draw their cash out and turn to the US looking for better, safer returns. The South Korea won rallied a day after the Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings agency raised the country\u2019s credit rating. The dollar fell to 1,176.03 won from 1,186.32 won Tuesday in Tokyo. The greenback also fell to Sg$1,3997 from Sg$1.4035, to 4.2513 Malaysian ringgit from 4.3053 ringgit, to 46.67 Philippine pesos from 46.77 pesos, and to Tw$32.50 from Tw$32.57. However, it rose to 66.4375 Indian rupees from 66.4373 rupees, and to 36.00 Thai baht from 35.98 baht. The Australian dollar bought 71.61 US cents Wednesday in Tokyo, up from 71.22 on Tuesday and well up from the six-year lows below 69 cents touched last week.

He said Hong Kong could not copy directly from the West. The then undemocratic system in Hong Kong was based on the British system, and had been in practice for a century and a half. Deng said it would not be appropriate to introduce to such a system the separation of powers or a British or American parliamentary system, just so it could be seen as a democracy. After Deng's comments, the drafting committee ceased using the term \"separation of powers\". It thus came as no surprise that in Zhang Xiaoming's recent speech on \" A Correct Understanding of the Characteristics of the Political System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \", the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong ruled out the existence of separation of powers in Hong Kong and said that separation of powers can be built only on the basis of a political entity in possession of complete state sovereign power. While Zhang may be correct from a strictly legal point of view, in reality, the political system in Hong Kong has evolved since the colonial era to put in place by convention - in practice and in spirit - the principle of separation of powers. The three branches of government each have their own role and function, creating checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, while upholding judicial independence. Whatever term one may use to describe it, it is separation of powers in a real sense. Zhang described the chief executive as having a \"dual head\" status, that is, he is head of the Hong Kong government and at the same time head of the SAR. Zhang also said that the chief executive has \"dual accountability\", that is, he or she is accountable to the central government and also to the Hong Kong government. Both these \"dual\" characteristics, according to Zhang, mean that the chief executive has a special legal status that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. READ MORE:a0Leung Chun-ying questions Hong Kong's 'separation of powers' model after controversial remarks by Beijing official In an article published in October 2013, Hao Tiechuan, director of publicity, cultural and public affairs of the central government's liaison office here, recounted that in July 1987, while drafting of the Basic Law was in progress, the British sent to the Chinese a summary on the transition issues relating to the executive and the legislature. Hao said the British team agreed that the Hong Kong government should be led by a strong executive, but there should be appropriate checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, and the two sides should maintain a cooperative relationship. Hao also said that the British stated that the power to accept or reject laws passed by the Legislative Council and the power to dissolve Legco is important to the status of the chief executive under the constitution. During the colonial era, the governor, as the representative of the British monarch, held the power to approve or reject laws passed by legislature and the power to dissolve it, and thus had a status that truly transcended the executive and the legislature. By comparison, the chief executive has a much less \"transcendent\" status than the colonial governor. Whether the chief executive 'transcends'a0all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor First, by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, the governor was the representative of the British monarch, accountable only to the king or queen. Under Article 43 of the Basic Law, the chief executive is accountable to both the central government and the SAR government. Second, the governor was free to reject laws passed by Legco and was free to dissolve the legislature. Under Article 50 of the Basic Law, the chief executive has only very limited power in this regard. Third, there was no mechanism for the impeachment of the governor. Yet, the SAR legislature can initiate proceedings to impeach the chief executive in accordance with Article 73 of the Basic Law. Fourth, during the colonial era, the council did not have the power to force the governor to resign. Under Article 52 of Basic Law, the chief executive must resign under certain specified circumstances.

Whether the chief executive \"transcends\" all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor, as suggested by Civic Party legislator Alan Leong Kah-kit. Not only does he not have an imperial sword, as former education chief Michael Suen Ming-yeung stated, but, rather, recent events - including the High Court ruling against the Chief Executive in Council's decision to refuse to issue a TV licence - clearly show that the SAR's vibrant and independent judiciary is the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the \"transcendent\" chief executive.

It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did.

She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot.\" As for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. \"The fans have been so kind,\" she says. \"I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving.

The law firm of Hardison & Cochran, Attorneys at Law, wants to channel some of that energy to raise awareness of autism, a common developmental disability. Ben Cochran, managing partner of the Raleigh law firm, announced today the firm is joining forces with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Football to increase understanding of autism, a brain disorder with widely varying effects, and the needs of those affected by it. \"We're excited to be partners with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Athletics again this football season to raise autism awareness in the Tar Heel State,\" Cochran said. \"Our mission is to help North Carolina families.

In addition to the game sponsorship, Hardison & Cochran will sponsor commercials highlighting autism awareness during Carolina football radio broadcasts as well as on Head Coach Larry Fedora's television show. The firm also will purchase advertising in the program to be sold to fans at this year's home games. Autism is a developmental disability that affects a person's behavior skills as well as their ability to communicate and interact socially. According to the Autism Society, more than 60,000 North Carolina residents cope with the Autism Spectrum Disorder, which refers to a group of developmental disabilities affecting a person's capacity to grasp what they see, hear and sense, such as classic autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). North Carolina's incidence of autism is higher than the national rate, with 1 in 58 people born with the disorder compared to 1 of 68 children across the country, according to the Autism Society of North Carolina.
